# TreraDataTask
## Task1
- the task was to read from scv file and i uploaded it with the source code so when you run the code you have to change the path pf the scv file according to your PC
- the final work of the task was to show the two lists included in the scv file as 2 spereate lists without limiting th size of the lists and without using ArrayLists
- So i used Queues as follows => while i'm reading input i push in the queue and when i finished i pop all the elements and print them

## Task2
- the task was to make 2 scrollbar Tables and make them movable by pressing on the tables  so i made 2 tables and add them to scrollbar and added to the action listener to each of them so it can be draggable on the panel

##Task 3 
- the task was a compeltion of task2 so it was to link each elements with the same content with a line or link 
- So my approach is to make a movable link and resizable at the same time so you can move any table and adjust it's line connecting the elemnts together manually
